# RESTAURANT_PAGE
This project is made as a way to promote the traditional foods that ETHIOPIA has to offer. I did it as part of my odin project's project solution. 
It is dynamically created using only javaScript and almost no HTML element used, except
the container I used to append the elements created in javaScript. I also used webpack to bundle my modules.
